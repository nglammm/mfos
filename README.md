# Welcome to MicroflashOS!

---

## What is it?

Microflash Operating System (MicroflashOS or mfos) is a "fantasy operating system" made in Batch.
It is primarily centered around the [MicroflashOS lore file](https://knbn1.github.io/sitefiles/microflash/mfos-lore.txt), as a result any names mentioned are references to the lore.

Please read [disclaimer.md](https://github.com/knbn1/microflash-os/blob/main/disclaimer.md) before installing.

Code is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, you are free to make your own derivative/fork of MicroflashOS.

---

## Compatibility

I normally test under Wine (Arch Linux)

Sometimes it may crash on Windows 10 when typing a command. I don't know why.

---

## Installation

Download the latest release and run the Batch file.

On install, the Batch file creates a "system disk" named ```MicroflashOS``` in the same location as the Batch file.
All operating system data is stored inside that folder. MicroflashOS does NOT attempt to modify your computer further.

After it is "installed" just run the Batch file every "startup".

---

## Updating MicroflashOS

In most cases, simply download the latest release's Batch file and run it.

Then simply run ```recovery``` to reboot to recovery mode to reinstall.

Upon updating MicroflashOS, only the ```mfos``` folder is modified. 
Any leftover user data in ```userdata``` is left intact. 
However, this depends on what changes are introduced in the latest version and whether or not it will affect the userdata partition.
If a release does break something, it will be made clear in the release notes.

Note that if a release makes changes to the system partition, a missing/modified file is often enough to automatically reboot to recovery.

---

## I need help!

In MicroflashOS, you can type ```help``` to get a list of all available commands. Packages can choose to add their own commands to this section.

Here are some useful commands to start with:

- ```about```: Shows some system info
- ```clock```: Shows date and time
- ```mkdir```: Create directory
- ```mkfile```: Create a file
- ```del```: Delete file/directory
- ```cd```: Change directory
- ```list```: List accessible files and directories *from current location* (similar to Linux ```ls``` or Windows ```dir```)

---

## MicroflashOS Package Manager

MicroflashOS includes a "package manager" called ```mfpkg```. 
It handles standalone packages in the ```.mfp``` format, otherwise it acts as a bootstrap for installers (such as the one used to install DevTools)

- List available packages in repository: ```mfpkg-repo-available```.
  The included repository as of the latest stable release is the *GigaflashOS Unified Repository [Revision 1]*
- List installed packages: ```mfpkg-list```
- Install/uninstall package: ```mfpkg-install``` or ```mfpkg-uninstall``` respectively.
- QUICKLY install/uninstall package: ```mfpkg-dl-[package ID]``` or ```mfpkg-rm-[package ID]``` respectively.

---

## DevTools (Developer Tools)

Some packages may require DevTools to function properly.

Install package ID ```001```.

Installing DevTools also opens up some more commands that can be viewed via ```help```.

---

## Jailbreak???

As part of the lore, MicroflashOS has a jailbreak called Flashbreak, which has been faithfully recreated here. 
Some packages may require Flashbreak to function properly.

Install package ID ```002```.

---

## Uninstallation

Simply delete the MicroflashOS Batch file and the folder named ```MicroflashOS```

---

## Reset to "stock" (remove ALL user settings)

Run ```homewipe```. A new userdata partition will be generated on next boot.
Please be careful with this command to avoid data loss!

## File formats

MicroflashOS utilises some proprietary file formats:

- ```.mcm```: MicroflashOS Core Module, reserved for critical system modules (sysmodules) that are required for MicroflashOS. **It is recommended you do not modify files with this extension.**
- ```.mfm```: MicroflashOS Module, these are non-critical sysmodules that don't affect the system *much* but you should still be careful with them.
- ```.mfp```: MicroflashOS Package, used by packages installed from ```mfpkg```. Deleting these will leave the package in a broken/unusable state, which can only be resolved by reinstalling the package.

---

## Directories

The system disk consists of two "partitions": ```mfos``` and ```userdata```

- ```mfos``` contains the operating system itself. Sysmodules are stored here.
- ```userdata``` contains, well, user data.
  Inside each user directory (set by the Batch variable ```%username%```) is a directory named ```mfosdata``` that contains user-specific packages and toggles.
  If ```mfosdata``` is ever corrupted it will simply be regenerated on next boot. Note that user settings and/or packages may be missing.

---

## Toggles

Toggles are configurations that can be configured (of course).
Note that accessing and/or modifying these requires DevTools.

Some noteworthy ones:

- ```slowboot```: Add pauses during boot sequence, allowing the user to see the boot process in greater detail as it automatically clears itself once the shell has been initialized.
- ```showdir```: Show the current directory above the prompt. Useful for navigating complex directory trees.

---

## Reading log messages (as of 2026.04.01)

By default a file named ```mfos-log.txt``` is created in the same directory as the Batch file. 
(This behavior can be disabled with the ```nolog``` toggle.)

Log messages follow this format:

```[a] b: c```

where ```a``` is the running process, ```b``` is the message type (either ```INFO```, ```WARN```, ```DEBUG``` or ```ERROR```) and ```c``` is the log message.

---

## Roadmap:

- More packages (maybe some games)
- MicroflashOS Updater
- ```robolibs``` (added database manager in ```2026.03.18-rbtest```, still some more lore-specific stuff to add)
- More repositories (maybe have a distinction between official packages from Kenneth and GigaflashOS CFW packages?)
- More jailbreak-y stuff (I have some handwritten lore pages that need to be released for that though)
- Bug fixes (never gets old!), mostly just looking for any weird situations
- Future-proofing (making things more universal and easier to modify)
